# FAQ


## What is Virtual JBUG?

Virtual JBUG provides regular user-group-style sessions over Google Hangouts on Air. We also broadcast other events like conference sessions. 

## Where does the community live?

* The community for the live events lives here: http://www.meetup.com/JBoss-User-Group-Worldwide/
* The archive of past sessions lives here: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrAKwbOeiDKtTShxLCKFvNg

## What topics do you cover?
Our sessions are developer focused and cover Red Hat Middleware related technologies. Otherwise we are pretty flexible on what sessions we host.

## What is the rough agenda for a vJBUG session?
Typically we have one speaker and one MC. The MC is responsible for:

* Managing the Google Hangout
* Monitoring the IRC discussion
* Interrupting the speaker to ask questions from the audience
* Kicking off the session
* Introducing the speaker.
* Closing the session.

The speaker is responsible for:

* Introducing themselves
* Delivering the presentation
* Responding to questions

## How long do sessions last?
Ideally 1hr, although some over-run.

## Why present at vJBUG?
* Reach out to a wider developer community globally.
* You get a recording that you can market after the event
* vJBUG has an established community that follow our events, making it easy for you to draw a decent sized audience.
* vJBUG has a marketing strategy that is applied to all events. You don't need to do this yourself.
* Presence on www.jboss.org for advertising your event and publicizing the recording after the event.

## What time of day do the sessions run?
Our community [seems to prefer 17:00 UTC](http://doodle.com/az2w73u2p74sx4h5p3w4gttk/admin#table). That is also a good time for me (Paul Robinson) to MC the event. However, we are flexible on this as we apreciate always using the same time slot will alienate large portions of the community. 

## I want to present something, what's my next step?
Send an email to paul.robinson@redhat.com and meisele@redhat.com with:

1) Your idea for a session
2) Title and abstract. We don't need this for the initial conversation, but we do need it before the event is scheduled.
3) Roughly when you would like to present

Ideally provide one month's notice to ensure that we can publicise the event adequately. Note that we can't publicise the event until the title and abstract is provided.

## What are the system requirements for presenting at vJBUG?
As long as get a good experience from Google Hangouts, at the location you intend to present from, then you should be fine. In general you should have a decent internet connection, webcam and microphone. For more info see [Google's document on this](https://support.google.com/plus/answer/1216376?hl=en-GB).

## I run a JBUG or JUG and would like to partner with vJBUG. What are my options?
One of the long-term goals for vJBUG is to draw content from the wider community. In return vJBUG can provide a single publicity machine and an established community waiting to consume the content. We can also provide advice on recording and broadcasting your sessions.

In general we see the following options available for sessions:

| Number | Description | Audience | Speaker | Live Broadcast? | Recorded 
|--------|-------------|----------|---------|-----------------|---------
| 1      | Traditional session | Local | Local | No | No 
| 2      | Traditional Recorded Session | local | Local | No | Yes
| 3      | Traditional Session with Remote Audience | Local+Remote | Local | Yes | Yes
| 4      | Virtual Session | Remote | Remote | Yes | Yes
| 5      | Traditional session with remote speaker | Local | Remote | No | Yes
| 6      | Virtual Session with local audience | Local+Remote | Remote | Yes | Yes
