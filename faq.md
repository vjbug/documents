# FAQ


## What is Virtual JBUG?

Virtual JBUG provides regular user-group-style sessions over Google Hangouts on Air. We also broadcast other events like conference sessions. 

## Where does the community live?

* The community for the live events lives here: http://www.meetup.com/JBoss-User-Group-Worldwide/
* The archive of past sessions lives here: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrAKwbOeiDKtTShxLCKFvNg

## What topics do you cover?
Our sessions are developer focused and cover Red Hat Middleware related technologies. Otherwise we are pretty flexible on what sessions we host.

## What is the rough agenda for a vJBUG session?
Typically we have one speaker and one MC. The MC is responsible for:

* Managing the Google Hangout
* Monitoring the IRC discussion
* Interrupting the speaker to ask questions from the audience
* Kicking off the session
* Introducing the speaker.
* Closing the session.

The speaker is responsible for:

* Introducing themselves
* Delivering the presentation
* Responding to questions

## How long do sessions last?
Ideally 1hr, although some over-run.

## Why present at vJBUG?
* Reach out to a wider developer community globally.
* You get a recording that you can market after the event
* vJBUG has an established community that follow our events, making it easy for you to draw a decent sized audience.
* vJBUG has a marketing strategy that is applied to all events. You don't need to do this yourself.
* Presence on www.jboss.org for advertising your event and publicizing the recording after the event.

## What time of day do the sessions run?
Our community [seems to prefer 17:00 UTC](http://doodle.com/az2w73u2p74sx4h5p3w4gttk/admin#table). That is also a good time for me (Paul Robinson) to MC the event. However, we are flexible on this as we apreciate always using the same time slot will alienate large portions of the community. 

## I want to present something, what's my next step?
Send an email to paul.robinson@redhat.com and meisele@redhat.com with:

1) Your idea for a session
2) Title and abstract. We don't need this for the initial conversation, but we do need it before the event is scheduled.
3) Roughly when you would like to present

Ideally provide one month's notice to ensure that we can publicise the event adequately. Note that we can't publicise the event until the title and abstract is provided.

## What are the system requirements for presenting at vJBUG?
As long as you get a good experience from Google Hangouts, at the location you intend to present from, then you should be fine. In general you should have a decent internet connection, webcam and microphone. For more info see [Google's document on this](https://support.google.com/plus/answer/1216376?hl=en-GB).

## I run a JBUG or JUG and would like to partner with vJBUG. What are my options?
One of the long-term goals for vJBUG is to draw content from the wider community. In return vJBUG can provide publicity and an established community waiting to consume the content. We can also provide advice on recording and broadcasting your sessions.

In general we see the following options available for sessions (not all of which would involve vJBUG):

| Number | Description | Audience | Speaker | Live Broadcast? | Recorded 
|--------|-------------|----------|---------|-----------------|---------
| 1      | Traditional session | Local | Local | No | No 
| 2      | Traditional Recorded Session | local | Local | No | Yes
| 3      | Traditional Session with Remote Audience | Local+Remote | Local | Yes | Yes
| 4      | Virtual Session | Remote | Remote | Yes | Yes
| 5      | Traditional session with remote speaker | Local | Remote | No | Yes
| 6      | Virtual Session with local audience | Local+Remote | Remote | Yes | Yes

For facilitating a remote audience we recomend using "Google Hangouts on Air". As well as being able to broadcast live to a (practically) unlimited number of people, you also get a YouTube recording of the session. We also reccomend using a a web chatroom to allow the remote audience to discuss the content and ask questions. If partnering with vJBUG you will use this one: https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=vjbug. 

If you just want a recording of your session then you could use other recording software (such as ScreenFlow) and then upload to YouTube. If you plan to support a live audience in the future, you might want to use Hangouts on Air from day one. This will allow you to gain confidence in the software, before accepting a live audience. 

Google Hangouts is also good for bringing in a remote speaker to a local session. Again, allowing a remote audience to attend becomes trivial. Here you would project the Hangout session onto a screen and use some capable speakers to allow the audience to hear the presenter. A decent Mic is also useful to allow the presenter to hear questions from the audience. For JBUG:Newcastle we have tried this a few times and we've found it to be good for getting quality presenters that wouldn’t normally be available. Providing the stream is good, the audience don’t seem to mind. We still offer food and drinks with an opportunity to socialise, so there is plenty of value-add over just watching from home.

If you are interrested in partnering with vJBUG, then we suggest you start by recording your sessions with Hangouts on Air. Providing the quality is acceptible, and the content is relavent, we can host these videos on the vJBUG YouTube channel and provide publicity. Once you are confident with the Hangouts on Air process, we can start publicising your events as vJBUG-events and direct audiences to your live feed.

After becoming a vJBUG partner, you should continue to market the local event seperately to the vJBUG event. Otherwise it can cause confusion. For example, when we have a JBUG:Newcastle event that is also broadcast live on vJBUG, we do a lot of marketing in Newcastle to get people to turn up to the event in person. In that marketing we don’t mention vJBUG in any way. Similarly when marketing the live stream, we do it under the vJBUG name and don’t disclose that there is a physical event in Newcastle. This split is also good for your user-group. We leave you to build your own own local community in a way that makes sense in your local. vJBUG then focuses on building a single, unified community across the globe providing live streams and on-demand sessions.

If becoming a vJBUG partner interests you then please contact paul.robinson@redhat.com and meisele@redhat.com. We'd love to hear from you!
