= Instructions for Hosting an Event

1. Open the https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NMnQjmzPPgikNHAqjoY8qzn1mFJ_WYkoUqyF9dMYUxg/edit#gid=0[schedule spreadsheet]
2. Identify the row that relates to the event you want to schedule.
3. Work your way across, from left to right, completing the required tasks, and updating the status when it's done. An 'x' means it is done. An 'NA' means that it's not appropriate for this event, so not done.

See bellow for details on how to fulfill each step.

Fill out the details for the event. Note:

* The time has to be in UK time. That's UTC (GMT) in the autumn/winter but UTC+1 (BST) in the spring/summer
* The YouTube link should go to the YouTube event page you created earlier.
* The timezone calculator link can be modified, based on an example taken from a previous meetup event.
* Take care to use the appropriate timezone examples, based on whether daylight saving is in-force during the event. (e.g PDT vs PST).
* Ideally get a decent bio from the presenter. One that is better than in this example would be good.

Click to create the event. Don't announce it yet! That should be done shortly after the preceding event finishes.
